    <h1>Ranking the greatest MMA fighters of all time</h1>
    <div>Mixed martial arts (MMA) has been around forever. Over the past few decades, its popularity has skyrocketed thanks to the UFC and other MMA promotions. Nowadays, the UFC rivals professional boxing and has arguably surpassed it in some respects. 

With that being said, let's evaluate the greatest UFC fighters of all time. </div>

    <div class="fighter">
        <img src="jones.jpg" alt="Fighter 1">
        <h2>1. Jon 'Bones' Jones(27-1-1NC) </h2>
        <p>Weight: 248 lbs</p>
        <p>Height: 6 ft 4 in</p>
        <p>Jones was a dominant fighter. He enjoyed a meteoric rise as the UFC's light heavyweight champion, winning 11 title defenses. Throughout his career, he's beaten the likes of Quinton "Rampage" Jackson, Rashad Evans, Daniel Cormier, and Vitor Belfort. The best light heavyweight of all time, his only loss was by disqualification because of throwing illegal elbows. While his off-field issues have been highly publicized, he's still one of the greats. 

In recent news, Jones jumped to the heavyweight division and beat Cyril Gane for the vacant championship belt. Becoming a two-division champion caused Jones' legacy to skyrocket to GOAT status.

        <img src="gsp.jpg" alt="Fighter 2">
        <h2>2. Georges St.Pierre (26-2-0)  </h2>
        <p>Weight: 170 lbs</p>
        <p>Height: 5 ft 10 in</p>
        <p>George St-Pierre is the greatest MMA fighter of all time. He learned karate after being bullied by kids at elementary school. From this suffering, he found his calling. The rest is history. St-Pierre's run as the welterweight champion of the UFC was legendary. In his prime, St-Pierre went on a 13-fight winning streak along with nine consecutive title defenses. St-Pierre has recorded the most takedowns in UFC history. 

After vacating the welterweight title and leaving the octagon for four years, St-Pierre beat Michael Bisping for the middleweight title. He became just the fourth fighter in UFC history to become a two-division champion. After the fact, he vacated the middleweight title because of ulcerative colitis. St-Pierre is the rare fighter who walked away at the top.  </p>

    <div class="fighter">
        <img src="anderson.jpg" alt="Fighter 3">
        <h2>3. Anderson Silva (34-11 1 NC)</h2>
        <p>Weight: 185 lbs</p>
        <p>Height: 6 ft 4 in</p>
        <p>The greatest striker of all time, Silva was unstoppable in his prime. He spent 2,457 days as middleweight champion, the longest title reign in UFC history. This record may never be broken. The Brazilian brawler won 16 fights in a row and defended his middleweight championship 10 times. After breaking his fibula and tibia, Silva was never the same. Despite ending his career with a 1-5 record, it didn't tarnish Silva's legacy. His championship bout with Chael Sonnen in UFC 117 exemplifies his resiliency and will to win. </p>

     <div class="fighter">
        <img src="Demetrious.jpg" alt="Fighter 2">
        <h2>4. Demetrious "Mighty Mouse" Johnson (27-3-1)  </h2>
        <p>Weight: 135 lbs</p>
        <p>Height: 5 ft 3 in</p>
        <p>Don't let his size fool you (5-foot-3, 125 pounds), Johnson is one of the GOATs. A great wrestler, his lightning-fast takedowns and ground-and-pound style devastated his opponents. Johnson was the UFC's first flyweight champion. He didn't look back, defending his title 11 times. Clearly the best flyweight in UFC history, he was dethroned in 2018. Now, he fights in ONE Championship, an MMA promotion based in Singapore.

     <div class="fighter">
        <img src="jose.jpg" alt="Fighter 2">
        <h2>5. Jose 'Scarface' Aldo (31-8) </h2>
        <p>Weight: 145 lbs</p>
        <p>Height: 5 ft 8 in</p>
        <p>Aldo started in World Extreme Cagefighting and worked his way up to the UFC, where he became the featherweight champion. Aldo recorded eight title defenses during his reign as champion before being dethroned by Conor McGregor in 2015. He was lethal at Brazilian jiu-jitsu and spent much of his career putting his opponents to sleep. At one point in his career, he didn't lose for over a decade and won 18 fights in a row. After a long career, Aldo finally retired in 2022.S
